 LIJ_multireligiousity_desc:0 "The Nashi are traditionally led by their native dongbas in matters pertaining to religion. Through both Han Chinese and Tibetan cultural influences, Tibetan Buddhism has gained widespread respect (especially in the case of the Mosuo). Taoism, and particularly its fengshui practices have been widely practiced since the tenth century. If our people believe in multiple religions, why not grant our subjects this freedom?"

 LIJ_dongba_script_desc:0 "The Dongba script is a system of pictographic glyphs used by the priests of the Naxi people in southern China. In the Naxi language it is called 'stone records'. They were developed in approximately the seventh century, and the glyphs may be used as rebuses for abstract words which do not have glyphs."
 LIJ_native_gods:0 "Nature Gods"
 LIJ_native_gods_desc:0 "The Dongba religion is based on the relationship between nature and man. In Dongba mythology, Nature and Man are half-brothers, having different mothers. According to the villagers of Shu Ming Village, nature is controlled by spirits called Shv. These gods are depicted as human-snake chimeras. The Dongba priests practice rituals such as the Shv Gv to appease these spirits and prevent their anger from boiling into natural disasters such as earthquakes and droughts. Our villages have shrines or places of worship dedicated to nature gods, such as Shu. Nakhi people still profess belief in the nature and man relationship."

 LIJ_to_repay_the_debts_of_a_tree_desc:0 "One of the most widely practised Dongba rituals, Zzerq Ciul Zhuaq, has been conducted if somebody was stricken with illness or bad luck, when a Dongba priest would be consulted. On many occasions, the result would show that the person had carried out logging or washing of dirty things in the forest, and the family or person concerned would have to ask the Dongba priest to hold the ritual near where the activity had taken place, and apologise to the nature god Shu. Being a conservative people, the villagers prohibited logging, and even the cutting of tree branches and gathering of dry pine-needles from the coniferous trees wasn't generally allowed."

 TIB_vassal_diplomacy:0 "Vassal Diplomacy"
 TIB_vassal_diplomacy_desc:0 "Tibet is a land of high mountains, hard to traverse and exert control over. So it is a natural habit for Tibetan empires to keep local chiefs and kings as vassals, only for them to become de-facto independent of their rule. But we are not like that! We will actually exert control over our subjects so we won’t fall to the same mistakes all great Tibetan empires face!"

 TIB_ganden_phodrang_desc:0 "Kings and emperors have come and gone, and they always fall due to the everlasting issue of succession; having the highest religious figure in Tibetan Buddhism in charge not only makes us very legitimate in the eyes of our subjects, but also makes us more stable."
 TIB_neo_tibetan_armor:0 "Neo-Tibetan Armor"
 TIB_neo_tibetan_armor_desc:0 "The Tibetan military’s armor was so good that the men and horses all wear chain mail armor. Its workmanship is extremely fine. It envelops them completely, leaving openings only for the two eyes. Thus, strong bows and sharp swords cannot injure them. When they do battle, they must dismount and array themselves in ranks. When one dies, another takes his place. To the end, they are not willing to retreat. Their lances are longer and thinner than those in China. Their archery is weak but their armor is strong."
