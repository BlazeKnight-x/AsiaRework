 string_start_korea:1 "In 1392, The §YKingdom of Great Joseon§! emerged from the ashes of the previous §YGoryeo§! kingdom, which had become weak from internal strife and the §YMongolian§! vassalization. Although questionable at first, Joseon Korea's connection to §YMing China§! has become strong: Both nations were born out of the collapse of the Mongols, were both followers of Confucianism, and viewed each other as part of the civilized world. The two nations would exchange goods and culture in the form of tributes and fight against common raiders in the north and the east.\n\nThe achievements of the first century of §YJoseon§! rule were considerable. In the early 15th century, the northern provinces of §YHamgyong§! were annexed from the §YJurchens§!, allowing the Koreans to extend their border to the Tumen River. There was also a flourishing of academia and knowledge. In particular, the Hangul alphabet was introduced in 1446 by the great §YKing Sejong§!. Unlike the Chinese script, it was designed to be both easy to learn and easy to adapt to the Korean language, making its use far more convenient and allowing a far broader section of society to read scholarly texts. Further notable progress was made in the fields of agriculture, gunpowder and the codification of the law, and major efforts were made to survey and record the geography of the land. This peace and unity has let the §YJoseon Kingdom§! become one of the most populous and developed nations in the world.\n\nHowever, §YJoseon§! may have new threats rise soon if it continues to remain peaceful. To the north await the warlike §YJurchens§! - although presently divided, should they come to be unified under a strong leader, conflict may soon follow. Similarly, across the sea to the east lies §YJapan§!, a nation of warring §Ydaimyos§! and would-be §Yshoguns§!. Korea must be vigilant, lest a united Japan or Manchuria seek to challenge Korea’s dominant position. Finally, although Joseon is strong, prestige will come to the ruler who can restore the former glory of the §YGoguryeo Empire§!!"
 string_start_jurchens:2 "The Han know well the dangers of allowing the §YJurchens§! to unite. In the 12th century the Jurchen warlord §YAguda§! united the Jurchens in rebellion against the §YLiao§!, founding the state of §YJin§! and crowning himself §YEmperor Taizu§!. The §YMing§! dynasty wishes to avoid another Jurchen uprising, and takes measures to ensure that they continue to fight among themselves with no faction becoming too powerful. To that end, Ming has established a loose overlordship over the §YJianzhou§! and §YHaixi§! Jurchens.\n\nOf the Jurchen tribes the Jianzhou are by far the most powerful. Like the Haixi they are a settled people; the institutions and philosophies of Chinese rule are slowly spreading into the region and being embraced by local Khans.\n\nDespite the encroachment of Chinese rule and customs, the settled Jurchens retain most of the same traditions and the warrior-culture of the ‘Wild Jurchens’ to the north. The nomadic §YNanais§!, §YEvenks§!, and many more are far from powerless.\n\n§YKorea§! often finds itself at odds with the Jurchens, and has only recently annexed the north-eastern provinces of §YYukjin§! and §YGyeongseong§! from a branch of the Jianzhou. Both the Jurchens and Koreans consider §YPaektu Mountain§! to be a sacred place, and each believe that they alone should have access to the holy peak.\n\nThe Jurchens and the §YMongols§! have an ever-changing relationship. Sometimes allies and sometimes bitter rivals, the tribes of both people often intermarry to secure political ties, and dynastic feuding is common. The §YMongols§! under §YEsen Taishi§! have unified and may set their sights on expanding into Jurchen land if they are not contained.\n\nThe Jurchen Khans remember the days of Jin fondly. If they are able to overcome the divisions between the tribes and keep the Mongols at bay they may yet rise again under a new leader, defeat the Ming, and forge for themselves a new identity."

However, the Four Oirats, under the leadership of Esen Taishi, have united the Mongols and plans to attack the Ming dynasty to reconquer China. \n  - §MIf the Oirats win a war against Ming China and own Beijing, then they will automatically form Yuan and integrate all their tumen.

Recently, Korea has lost control over the tribes in Jianzhou, as they have turned to be tributaries of the Ming Empire over Joseon. \n  - §MJoseon cannot attack Jurchens that are a tributary of Ming unless Joseon is not a tributary of Ming or Joseon completes its Empire mission.§!\n\nEast Asia is home to the §YJapanese Isles§!.\nFar from a united state, the island of Japan is divided into its many constituent territories controlled by local strongmen, the §YDaimyo§!.\nThe power over these Daimyo does not, in practice, lie with the Emperor but with his deputy, the §YShogun§!.\n\nThe current holders of the Shogun title are the §Y[Root.start_shogun_holders_through_the_years]§!, but they are weak and feeble.
