They originated from the later Goryeo period, although during the early Joseon era they were forced to retreat to the countryside by the aristocratic Hungu. The Sarim push for reform of Joseon's decadent systems, which challenges the entrenched Hungu faction. As devout Neo-Confucianists, the Sarim is very intolerant of religion, such as Buddhism and Muism."
