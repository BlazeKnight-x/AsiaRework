 GC_ASIA_BOOKMARK_DESC: "In 1444, the Great Ming Empire, rising from the ashes of the previous Mongolian Yuan Dynasty, looks to be threatened again by the Mongols. Esen Taishi of the Oirat Confederation has managed to unite the Mongols under his rule, and his eyes seem set on reconquering China. As the Mongols prepare for conflict with the Ming, the Japanese clans in the east also prepare for war. The weak Ashikaga shogunate is unable to keep the local daimyo in check, and the rivalry between the powerful Hosokawa and Yamana clans look to erupt in full civil war for the Shogunate. Between them lies the Kingdom of Joseon, which is experiencing a golden age under the aging Sejong the Great, although they must deal with Chinese meddling in their political ambitions in Manchuria."
