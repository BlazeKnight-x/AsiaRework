 kor_factionalism.1.t: "A Newborn Prince's Fate"
 kor_factionalism.1.d: "Although our king has been married for quite a long time, our consort has not succeeded in producing a legitimate heir. Quite surprisingly, a woman of the underpowered faction produced a male child, and debates are going on whether we should designate him as [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s heir."
 kor_factionalism.1.a: "He is my rightful heir."
 kor_factionalism.1.b: "Wonderful, but he cannot be my heir."
 kor_factionalism.2.t: "Japanese Threats"
 kor_factionalism.2.d: "We have received news that Japan has been united. The West faction is arguing that they'll try to invade us next, but the East Faction suggests that they'll never do such an unlawful thing."
 kor_factionalism.2.a: "We must prepare for any future threats."
 kor_factionalism.2.b: "It's a waste of time and money."
 kor_factionalism.3.t: "Manchu Threats"
 kor_factionalism.3.d: "We have received news that Manchuria has been united. The East faction is arguing that they'll try to invade us next, but the West Faction suggests that they are still under Chinese influence and thus will not disturb the balance of the region."
 kor_factionalism.3.a: "We must prepare for any future threats."
 kor_factionalism.3.b: "It's a waste of time and money."
 kor_factionalism.4.t: "War Against Joseon"

 kor_factionalism.4.b: "Not right now."
 kor_factionalism.5.t: "Jujahak"
 kor_factionalism.5.d: "Zhu Xi is a prominent Chinese philosopher that lived during the Song dynasty. His works of Confucian philosophy greatly influenced Korean Confucianism, and later became known as 'Jujahak' in Korean. Many Korean philosophers, including the faction leaders, are still debating over the interpretations of his writings."
 kor_factionalism.5.a: "Favor the West faction."
 kor_factionalism.5.b: "Favor the East faction."
 kor_factionalism.6.t: "The Ijo Jeonrang"
 kor_factionalism.6.d: "The factions are disagreeing on who we should appoint as the new Ijo Jeonrang. The Ijo, Ministry of Personnel, is the head of the Six ministries of Joseon. It holds the power of appointing government officials. The position of Ijo Jeonrang is very important, as it has the privilege of promoting scholar-officials. The importance of Ijo Jeonrang caused many problems during Joseon's factional strife, as the faction that controls the position can hold a firm grip over the Joseon court."
 kor_factionalism.6.a: "Support the Westerner candidate."
 kor_factionalism.6.b: "Support the Easterner candidate."
 kor_factionalism.7.t: "Huibin Jang"
 kor_factionalism.7.d: "Jang Okjeong was the daughter of Jang Hyeong and his second wife, Lady Yoon of the Papyeong Yoon clan. Okjeong is widely thought to have been one of the most beautiful women in Joseon, and her charm was mentioned in the Annals. Okjeong became a concubine with the rank of Suk-won, but she was elevated to So-ui after she produced [Root.Heir.GetName], a male heir of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]. Her ambitions got bigger, and now she wants to elevate herself to the position of the queen."
 kor_factionalism.7.a: "Make her a queen!"
 kor_factionalism.7.b: "That's a bit too radical."
 kor_factionalism.8.t: "Heir Shows Concern"
 kor_factionalism.8.d: "As our crowned heir matures, he is showing concern on the current factional dispute that might result in a one-party dictatorship. Unfortunately, the party knows this, and they don't want to lose their privileges."
 kor_factionalism.8.a: "Tell [Root.Heir.GetTitle] [Root.Heir.GetName] that [Root.Heir.GetSheHe] should cope with the administrators."
 kor_factionalism.8.b: "[Root.Heir.GetSheHe] has a point."
 kor_factionalism.9.t: "Infertile"
 kor_factionalism.9.d: "Although our king is old enough, he hasn't produced a single heir. The ruling party thinks that he is infertile, and demands that he should appoint his brother as heir. It is a very rude thing to do, and it's obvious that they want a new king that favors their party."
 kor_factionalism.9.a: "How dare they?"
 kor_factionalism.9.b: "Accept their demands"
 kor_factionalism.10.t: "The Yesong Debate"
 kor_factionalism.10.d: "The old king's funeral brought controversies on how long Queen Jangryeol, The old king's stepmother, should have to wear funeral garment according to the Confucian form of funeral. The West faction contends that she needs to wear the funeral garment for only a year, while the East thinks that our previous king deserves a 3-year funeral since he succeeded the royal line. This conflict arose because there was no previous record about Confucian funeral requirements when somebody's second son who actually succeeded the family line dies. The West now insists that we should instead follow the Korean Grand Law, which says that a 1-year funeral is enough for both situations."
 kor_factionalism.10.a: "Follow the Grand Law."
 kor_factionalism.10.b: "My father deserves a 3-year funeral."
 kor_factionalism.11.t: "The Second Yesong Debate"
 kor_factionalism.11.d: "We thought that the old king's funeral issues were resolved, but now his wife Queen Inseon is dead. The West faction contends that Queen Jangryeol needs to wear the funeral garment for only nine months, while the East contends a full year. This second conflict arose because the first conflict never settled on whether our previous king was the legitimate successor of the royal line, and instead followed the Korean Grand Law."
 kor_factionalism.11.a: "Let's stick to the West logic."
 kor_factionalism.11.b: "I thought the West respected my father as the legitimate successor."
 kor_factionalism.12.t: "Factional Pretender Rebels"
 kor_factionalism.12.d: "The king's extreme favor of one faction has lead to the treachery of another. These rebels are trying to install a relative to the throne, who favors their party instead."
 kor_factionalism.12.a: "Crush them!"
 kor_factionalism.13.t: "No longer Favored"
 kor_factionalism.13.d: "The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has favored his heir for many years, but not anymore. Perhaps it's because the heir is incapable, maybe it's the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s jealousy. Either way, [Root.Heir.GetName] is no longer favored by the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], and the factions are noticing it."
 kor_factionalism.13.a: "I don't want to see [Root.Heir.GetName]'s face again."
 kor_factionalism.13.b: "Family is family, even though I hate [Root.Heir.GetHerHim]."
 kor_factionalism.14.t: "A New Heir to the Throne?"
 kor_factionalism.14.d: "[Root.Heir.GetName] was the legitimate heir to the throne, but things are turning out bad for [Root.Heir.GetHerHim]. Our consort gave birth to a male child, and her faction is supporting him as the new heir."
 kor_factionalism.14.a: "[Root.Heir.GetName] held [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] position well. [Root.Heir.GetSheHe] will still be my heir."
 kor_factionalism.14.b: "Legitimacy is important."
 kor_factionalism.15.t: "Hwanguk"
 kor_factionalism.15.d: "Although [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] maintained good relations with the dominant faction, they started to disagree on [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s decisions over time, while the other faction is supporting [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s policies more often. Maybe it's time to show the factions who is in control."
 kor_factionalism.15.a: "The tides are turning."
 kor_factionalism.15.b: "Maintain the current situation."
 kor_factionalism.16.t: "Report Against Treachery"
 kor_factionalism.16.d: "Our advisor is reporting that the opposing faction members are plotting against the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]!"
 kor_factionalism.16.a: "No need to escalate the conflict. Let's hear them out."
 kor_factionalism.16.b: "Arrest everybody related to the issue!"
 kor_factionalism.17.t: "Advisor Opposed by Rival Faction"
 kor_factionalism.17.d: "[Root.Adm_Advisor.GetName] served us for many years, and [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetHerHis] reputation is well known. Unfortunately, he has been leaning towards one faction, and the rival party is feeling intimidated. They are accusing [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetName] of [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetHerHis] misdeeds of the past, and claims that [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetSheHe] must retire."
 kor_factionalism.17.a: "[Root.Adm_Advisor.GetSheHeCap] will prove [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetHerHim]self worthy."
 kor_factionalism.17.b: "It's time to let [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetName] go."
 kor_factionalism.18.t: "Divided Views over Government Policies"
 kor_factionalism.18.d: "Our buraucrats are debating whether we should focus on taxation or enlistment. The East faction insists that we should focus in securing our tax income, while the West faction insists that we are in shortage of men."
 kor_factionalism.18.a: "We are in shortage of money."
 kor_factionalism.18.b: "Enlistment is more important."
 kor_factionalism.19.t: "Factional Favoritism"
 kor_factionalism.19.d: "Factional rivalry is worsening, and [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s policies only made it worse. It is apparent that the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] only favors one faction, and it is leading to the disloyalty of others."
 kor_factionalism.19.a: "It's because they're the party of virtues."
 kor_factionalism.19.b: "Maybe I should balance out the situation."
 kor_factionalism.20.t: "Heir Regency"
 kor_factionalism.20.d: "[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] is getting quite old, [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] decisions not as good as they used to be. Maybe [Root.Heir.GetTitle] [Root.Heir.GetName] can help [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] in administrating the country, and it will make our heir more capable for a future ruler."
 kor_factionalism.20.a: "Declare heir regency."
 kor_factionalism.20.b: "[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] does not need any help in ruling [Root.GetName]."
 kor_factionalism.21.t: "Banjeong Contributors"
 kor_factionalism.21.d: "[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] ousted the previous ruler and took the throne. But by doing so, [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] supporting faction also gained massive power, and they are demanding privileges as a return for their loyalty."
 kor_factionalism.21.a: "Who do they think they are?"
 kor_factionalism.21.b: "Grant them privileges."
 kor_factionalism.22.t: "Spreading Daedongbeop"
 kor_factionalism.22.d: "[Root.Adm_Advisor.GetName] is a brilliant administrator, and his advices helped the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] many times. According to [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetHerHis] words, it is urgently necessary to replace the indigenous products contribution system with Daedongbeop, a system that collects proportionate sharing of rice production. [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetName] believes that this system will reduce the burdens of pheasant tax while also increasing our taxation efficiency."
 kor_factionalism.22.a: "Spread Daedongbeop."
 kor_factionalism.22.b: "We don't need to."
 kor_factionalism.23.t: "A Brilliant Reformer"
 kor_factionalism.23.d1: "The King has discovered a brilliant young Easterner. Not only is he excellent at traditional Confucian studies, but also has a vision to change the fundamentals of the [Root.GetAdjective] economy. If we promote him through the ranks, we can perhaps reduce the influence of the West faction."
 kor_factionalism.23.d2: "The King has discovered a brilliant young Westerner. Not only is he excellent at traditional Confucian studies, but also has a vision to change the fundamentals of the [Root.GetAdjective] economy. If we promote him through the ranks, we can perhaps reduce the influence of the East faction."
 kor_factionalism.23.a: "Promote him."
 kor_factionalism.23.b: "No special treatments."
 kor_factionalism.24.t: "Promoting an Advisor"
 kor_factionalism.24.d1: "[Root.Adm_Advisor.GetName] is one of our best advisors, and [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetSheHe] definitely needs a promotion. Unfortunately, [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetSheHe] favors the West faction, so by promoting [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetHerHim] we might disturb the factional balance."
 kor_factionalism.24.d2: "[Root.Adm_Advisor.GetName] is one of our best advisors, and [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetSheHe] definitely needs a promotion. Unfortunately, [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetSheHe] favors the East faction, so by promoting [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetHerHim] we might disturb the factional balance."
 kor_factionalism.24.a: "Promote [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetHerHim]."
 kor_factionalism.24.b: "Let's be careful."
 kor_factionalism.25.t: "The Grand Exams of Joseon"
 kor_factionalism.25.d: "The gwageo is the national civil service examination under the Joseon dynasty of Korea. Typically quite demanding, these tests measure candidates' ability of writing composition and knowledge of the Confucian classics. The form of writing varies from literature to proposals on management of the state."
 kor_factionalism.25.Ea: "This Eastern candidate has a deep understanding in literature and Confucian philosophy."
 kor_factionalism.25.Eb: "This Eastern candidate has a great insight in history and administration."
 kor_factionalism.25.Wa: "This Western candidate has a deep understanding in literature and Confucian philosophy."

 kor_factionalism.25.O: "Who is this unknown gentleman?"
 kor_factionalism.26.t: "The Munmyo Enshrinement of Yi I and Seong Hon"
 kor_factionalism.26.d: "The Munmyo is Korea's primary temple of Confucius, and notable Korean Confucian scholars are enshrined at the temple. Yi I and Seong Hon are great Westerner scholars from the 1500s who contributed a lot to Korean Confucianism. Now that the Westerners are in power, they are arguing that the two great scholars must be enshrined at the Munmyo."
 kor_factionalism.26.a: "They deserve the enshrinement."
 kor_factionalism.26.b: "The Easterners won't like this."
 kor_factionalism.27.t: "Remove Yi I and Seong Hon from the Munmyo"
 kor_factionalism.27.d: "Although Yi I and Seong Hon are praised as great scholars from the Westerners, they are not truly fit for the Munmyo enshrinement in the Eastern faction's eyes. Yi I had experience in practicing Mahayana, and Seong Hon's patriotism was questioned by his contemporary Easterners. As the Westerners are now removed from power, Easterners are arguing that the two scholars should be removed from the Munmyo."
 kor_factionalism.27.a: "They are not fit for the enshrinement."
 kor_factionalism.27.b: "The Westerners won't like this."
 kor_factionalism.28.t: "The Munmyo Restoration of Yi I and Seong Hon"
 kor_factionalism.28.d: "Yi I and Seong Hon are the spiritual leaders for the Westerners, and their Munmyo removal was totally unjust in the Western faction's perspective. Now that the deterrent Easterners are removed, it is only logical that the two great scholars should be restored to their rightful place."
 kor_factionalism.28.a: "We must fix the errors of the past."
 kor_factionalism.28.b: "I don't want to start it all over again."
 kor_factionalism.29.t: "The Queen's Favored Faction"
 kor_factionalism.29.d1: "Queen [Root.Consort.GetName] is a daughter of a Westerner family, and she isn't shying away in meddling with politics. She wants to strengthen the power of the West faction and considering her influence over the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], it's certainly not a thing to be ignored..."
 kor_factionalism.29.d2: "Queen [Root.Consort.GetName] is a daughter of an Easterner family, and she isn't shying away in meddling with politics. She wants to strengthen the power of the East faction and considering her influence over the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], it's certainly not a thing to be ignored..."
 kor_factionalism.29.a: "Anything for our dear queen."
 kor_factionalism.29.b: "That will disturb the factional balance."
 kor_factionalism.30.t: "Education for the Heir"
 kor_factionalism.30.d: "Educating an heir to make him a good ruler is always an important job for the country. The problem is that our heir's teacher is a factional hard-liner. While his teachings are beneficial, he might turn out making our heir biased towards his own side."
 kor_factionalism.30.a: "What bad could he possibly do?"
 kor_factionalism.30.b: "I think he should be doing other things rather than teaching our heir."
 kor_factionalism.31.t: "[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s ambitions"
 kor_factionalism.31.d1: "[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has never been a Westerner. During his early life, the West faction constantly tried to sabotage everything he did. Now that he's old enough and gathered his supporters, it's time for the West faction to give up their dominance."
 kor_factionalism.31.d2: "[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has never been an Easterner. During his early life, the East faction constantly tried to sabotage everything he did. Now that he's old enough and gathered his supporters, it's time for the East faction to give up their dominance."
 kor_factionalism.31.a: "The time for Hwanguk has come!"
 kor_factionalism.31.b: "On second thought, I'll just cope with their demands."
 kor_factionalism.32.t: "The Ruling Faction Rejects the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s policies"
 kor_factionalism.32.d1: "[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has never been a Westerner, and the West faction is fully aware of it. [Root.Monarch.GetHerHisCap] policies are often criticized and rejected, as the Westerners don't see the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] as their true ruler, but only as an enemy Easterner."
 kor_factionalism.32.d2: "[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has never been an Easterner, and the East faction is fully aware of it. [Root.Monarch.GetHerHisCap] policies are often criticized and rejected, as the Easterners don't see the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] as their true ruler, but only as an enemy Westerner."
 kor_factionalism.32.a: "Just give up the policy."
 kor_factionalism.32.b: "A mere faction cannot stop [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]!"
 kor_factionalism.33.t: "Balancing the Factions"
 kor_factionalism.33.d: "The factional struggles have lead to the utter dominance of one party, and now their influence is threatening the crown. Maybe we should counterbalance them by promoting the other side."
 kor_factionalism.33.a: "Promote the young of the weaker side."
 kor_factionalism.33.b: "Preposterous."
 kor_factionalism.34.t: "Talent or Legitimacy"
 kor_factionalism.34.d: "The lack of an heir is worrying both the people of [Root.Country.GetName] and your advisors. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] already has a few adult sons, and one of them is bright enough to succeed the throne. Unfortunately, he was not born to [Root.Consort.GetTitle] [Root.Consort.GetName], and appointing him as heir might anger the faction she belongs to..."
 kor_factionalism.34.a: "We must think of our country's future."
 kor_factionalism.34.b: "Legitimacy is important."
 kor_factionalism.992.t: "Jung Yakyong"
 kor_factionalism.992.d: "The King discovered a brilliant young Easterner. He is excellent at poetry, philosophy, literature, and even anatomy. But most importantly, he's a brilliant engineer. If we promote him through the ranks, we can perhaps reduce the influence of the West faction."
 kor_factionalism.992.a: "Promote him."
 kor_factionalism.992.b: "No special treatments."
 kor_factionalism.993.t: "Song Siyeol"
 kor_factionalism.993.d: "In the countryside, there is a hermit scholar who studied Confucian ideals for many years. The West faction worships him as their spiritual leader. We can gain wide support from the Western faction we bring him to court."
 kor_factionalism.993.a: "Bring him to court."
 kor_factionalism.993.b: "He will be happy with the Confucian studies."
 kor_factionalism.995.t: "Joseon Strengthens its Defense"
 kor_factionalism.995.d: "Rumors of our ambitions have leaked out, and now Joseon is reinforcing its forts."
